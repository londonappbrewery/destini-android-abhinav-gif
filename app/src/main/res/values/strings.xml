    <string name="T1_Story">T1_storyYour car has blown a tire on a winding road in the middle of nowhere with no cell phone reception. You decide to hitchhike. A rusty pickup truck rumbles to a stop next to you. A man with a wide brimmed hat with soulless eyes opens the passenger door for you and asks: \"Need a ride, boy?\". </string>
    <string name="T1_Ans1">T1ans1I\'ll hop in. Thanks for the help! </string>
    <string name="T1_Ans2">T1_Ans2Better ask him if he\'s a murderer first. </string>

    <string name="T2_Ans1">T2_Ans1At least he\'s honest. I\'ll climb in.</string>
    <string name="T2_Ans2">T2_Ans2Wait, I know how to change a tire.</string>

    <string name="T5_End">T5_EndAs you smash through the guardrail and careen towards the jagged rocks below you reflect on the dubious wisdom of stabbing someone while they are driving a car you are in.</string>
    <string name="T6_End">T6_EndYou bond with the murderer while crooning verses of "Can you feel the love tonight". He drops you off at the next town. Before you go he asks you if you know any good places to dump bodies. You reply: \"Try the pier.\"</string>
